# estimating-the-genomic-novelty-and-cultured-level-in-Archaea
Most studies relating to microbial diversity are challenging to carry out in laboratory settings because most microbes cannot be cultured in wet labs (Lloyd et al., 2018; Rinke et al., 2013).   These Phylogenetically diverse uncultured microbes dominate most of the Earth's environments and the increasing collection of metagenomes and reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from the Earth microbiomes has widened the scope for discovering novel genes with potential metabolic function (IMG/M Data Consortium et al., 2021). However, the degree of phylogenetic divergence of uncultured microbes from the cultured ones may not reflect the quantity of novel genes across different taxa or capture more novelty range across different environments (Lloyd et al., 2018). 
Sequence similarity searching using NCBI tools such as BLAST is one way to determine and quantify the identities of microbes by comparing their sequences to their closest cultured relatives (Lloyd et al., 2018). This search reports a similarity score (Bit score) where the increase in Bit score indicates increase in sequence similarity (Pearson, 2013; Weisman et al., 2020).  Homologs descend from common evolutionary ancestry, and homologs detected only within a taxa level, such as species, are referred to as novel or taxonomy restricted genes (Weisman et al., 2020).
Here, we applied a sequence similarity search approach to analyze the in silico genomic novelty present in the recent reconstructed uncultivated archaea. We used the same approach to estimate any relationship between the genomic novelty and degree cultivability of a specific microbe phylum.
